About "WordSet1_Ratings.xlsx":

This excel spreadsheet contains conceptual attribute ratings and other data on 535 English words, described in: Binder JR, Conant LL, Humphries CJ, Fernandino L, Simons SB, Aguilar M, Desai RH. (2016) "Toward a brain-based componential semantic representation", Cognitive Neuropsychology.  Please cite this article when using these materials.

Column A is a (somewhat) arbitrary ID number for each word. Items with ID 1-242 are from the KRNS Year 1 corpus (see Glasgow K, Roos M, Haufler A, Chevillet M, Wolmetz, M (2016). Evaluating semantic models with word-sentence relatedness. arXiv:1603.07253 [cs.CL]).

Column C codes the word class of the item (1 = noun, 2 = verb, 3 = adjective). Note that the word "used" was rated separately as a verb and as an adjective.

Column D lists the number of valid ratings obtained for each word.

Column E lists the mean correlation (across raters) between the ratings obtained from an individual rater and the group mean for that word, after removal of outliers. This gives a rough indication of the degree of inter-individual agreement for each word, but keep in mind that the sample of raters differed for each word.

Columns F to BR list the mean value on 65 conceptual attributes for each word. Note that verbs and adjectives were not rated on the Complexity attribute, and adjectives were not rated on the Practice or Caused attributes.

Columns BT to CB list a few lexical variables for each word. These include length; print frequency (in CELEX); log frequency; orthographic neighborhood size; orthographic neighborhood frequency; average constrained unigram, bigram, and trigram frequency; and imageability (pooled from various sources). See Binder et al. for details.

Column CD is a coding for general ontological type (same as word class, but verbs divided into actions and states).

Columns CE and CF code general and more specific a priori category labels.

Column CG codes category membership using categories generated from a k-means clustering of the ratings.
